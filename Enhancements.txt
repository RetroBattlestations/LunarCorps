Some ideas for enhancment:

 * Instead of drawing the lunar surface character by character, print
   a message saying "Scanning for landing site" and animate some
   scanner during the generation.

 * With the surface pre-generated, scroll it up slowly from the bottom
   while the lunar lander comes down from the top, until the whole
   lunar surface is at the bottom of the screen.

 * Convert the whole thing to graphics.

 * Make it into a game, with scoring and explosions and black jack.
